Created an Airflow instance but we didn't clone the github repo, as recommended by Jake.
The instance is named "Airflow2". It is open to every IP adress in the meantime, after this checlpoint is evaluated we will change the firewall to allow only our IPs to acess port 8080 of the instance.


Next Checkpoint

Create a DAG on your airflow VM instance that does the following:

- [ ]  Runs your ETL/ELT script for the given execution date
- [ ]  Has at least two tasks
- [ ]  At least one task should be dependent on the successful completion of one or more other tasks

Create an Instance Scheduler that does the following:

- [ ]  Starts your airflow vm at a specified time
- [ ]  Turns it off at a specified time

Then:

- [ ]  Run your DAG for at least 2 and no more than 5 days
- [ ]  Provide a README in your dags folder in Github explaining where we can find the data generated by your airflow dag
