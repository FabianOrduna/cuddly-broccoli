### Hi there üëã

Why are we awesome?

-	üî≠ Because Nelson is a geophysicist (no, earthquakes can‚Äôt be predicted), leftie and gamer.
-	üì´ Because Miguel is an economist/actuarial scientist and will judge you based on your p-values. 
-	‚ö° Because Jorge enjoys writting code and thinks that the cloud rocks. 
- üñ•Ô∏è Because Fabian is a software engineer with experience in web development, distributed systems and can hack your phone if he wants.

Together we can learn about each other, and we can solve many kinds of problems merging our skills as one brain to conquer Data Product Architecture.

# Project Proposal 

### 1. Objectives

1. What is the problem that your Data Product will solve? 

Football soccer is by far the most followed sport around the world. According to [topendsports](https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/fans.htm) football is the most popular sport globally approximately 3.5 billion fans followed by cricket with 2.5 billion fans. Many of these fans like to be aware of the odds for future games of their teams, specially with upcoming fooball classics like FC vs Real Madrid, Manchester United vs Liverpool or America vs Chivas in the mexican league. Another proportion of these followers are looking for betting tips. This data product is looking to predict the future football match outputs (win, loss or tie), this prediction could be used for informative means or as tips. 

2. If a company was to use this application, what would be their ML objectives and business objectives? 

### 2. Users

1. Who will be the users of your application?

Football fans looking for predictions about football game results. 

2. How are users going to interact with your application? 

Match results will be displayed in tables containing the opponents in the game and the probability of a win, loss or tie. Additionally, the user could be able to filter games by region, league or by date.

### 4. Data

1. Where would you get your data from? How much data would you need? Is there anything publicily available or do you need to build your own dataset? 

The data for our project will be extracted from the [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3), a free to use API containing Timezones, Countries, Leagues, Teams, Venues, Standings, Fixtures, Injuries, Predictions, Coachs, Players, Transfers, Trophies, Sidelined and Odds. 

The most important data that could be used as features for our predictive model are countries, leagues, teams, standings and predictions can be used to compare or even reinforce our model. 

*Build our own dataset?*
