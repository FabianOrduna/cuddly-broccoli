### Hi there üëã

Why are we awesome?

-	üî≠ Because Nelson is a geophysicist (no, earthquakes can‚Äôt be predicted), leftie and gamer.
-	üì´ Because Miguel is an economist/actuarial scientist and will judge you based on your p-values. 
-	‚ö° Because Jorge enjoys writting code and thinks that the cloud rocks. 
- üñ•Ô∏è Because Fabian is a software engineer with experience in web development, distributed systems and can hack your phone if he wants.

Together we can learn about each other, and we can solve many kinds of problems merging our skills as one brain to conquer Data Product Architecture.

# Project Proposal 

### 1. Objectives

1. What is the problem that your Data Product will solve? 

Football soccer is by far the most followed sport around the world. According to [topendsports](https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/fans.htm) football is the most popular sport globally approximately 3.5 billion fans followed by cricket with 2.5 billion fans. Many of these fans like to be aware of the odds for future games of their teams, specially with upcoming fooball classics like FC vs Real Madrid, Manchester United vs Liverpool or America vs Chivas in the mexican league. Another proportion of these followers are looking for betting tips. This data product is looking to predict the future football match outputs (win, loss or tie), this prediction could be used for informative means or as tips. 

2. If a company was to use this application, what would be their ML objectives and business objectives? 

ML Objetives. Reducir los falsos positivos. 
Business objetives. Aumentar el set de herramientas disponibles que le permitan a los apostaodres profesionales o amateurs tomar mejores decisiones

### 2. Users

1. Who will be the users of your application?

Football fans looking for predictions about football game results. 

2. How are users going to interact with your application? 

Match results will be displayed in tables containing the opponents in the game and the probability of a win, loss or tie. Additionally, the user could be able to filter games by region, league or by date.

### 4. Data

1. Where would you get your data from? How much data would you need? Is there anything publicily available or do you need to build your own dataset? 

The data for our project will be extracted from the [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3), a free to use API containing Timezones, Countries, Leagues, Teams, Venues, Standings, Fixtures, Injuries, Predictions, Coachs, Players, Transfers, Trophies, Sidelined and Odds. 

The most important data that could be used as features for our predictive model are countries, leagues, teams, standings and predictions can be used to compare or even reinforce our model. 

*Build our own dataset?* 

### 5. Modeling

Interface of users. We want a friendly interface for the user. The idea is that the user put a basic parameter of search that are league, team from home and team from away and thus obtain the probability of win, draw, and lose in each case. On the other hand, the request will display the last statistics of the teams to contribute to use the predicted choice or change it. The idea is to give to the client the tools that contribute to the best election. 

Model. The initial idea of the model is to adjust a neural network, logistic regression and any other algorithms to get the best model based on the match of the teams under local or visit conditions, number of goals and other statistics. We want to do a set up of the model at the end of each season ant put it in a production environment way in order to use for a new season. We do not plan to conserve the old model; each new train means re-write over the old model. 

Finally, each prediction displays main statistics of the teams. This statistic will conserve on the table, the idea is conserving the statistics of the last month into a data table in order to show repeat information for a different client user, that means, same match prediction result will display same statistics. To obtain new statistics that we do not consult previously we will request from the API the necessary information about it. 

Software. Python to train the models and PHP to display the front-end application. Postgres to data base management. The idea is use Postgres to conserve results of the prediction model to compare and implement improvements over the last production model. On the other hand, with Postgres we storage the data to train a model and the statistic of the requested matches. 

Scope. Our service only plan to predict match in one leagues that is Premier league. 


### 6. Evaluation

1. How would you evaluate your model performance, both during training and
inference?

We would evaluate if the percentage of false positives is strictly smaller than a threshold defined by the client. In this case, we understand a false positive as a situation where the model predicts a team will win a match when in reality the opposite happens. We believe false positives are what the client is ultimately interested in minimizing, whereas alternative measures like accuracy might be misleading.


2. How would you evaluate whether your application satisfies its objectives?

We would compare our performance against that of profesional betting houses. From the Football API we can retrieve betting odds from several webpages. If we can manage to get data of the results of professional gamblers, we might compare against them as well.

### 7. Inference

1. Will you be doing online prediction or batch prediction or a combination of both?

We intend to do batch prediction, however we might do online prediction if we can manage to.

2. Will the inference run on-device or through a server?

On-device 

3. Can you run inference on CPUs or an edge device or do you need GPUs?

We will only need CPUs.
