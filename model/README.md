### Data

Data is provided by [Api sports](https://api-sports.io/). The idea is to get relevant information about matches from the Premier League in order to predict the possible results of the competition. The requests to the API are done using an API Key and responses are return in a JSON format. As an example, hitting the fixtures endpoint we get back the following: 

```json
{
  "get":"fixtures"
    "parameters":{
    "league":"39"
    "season":"2020"
  }
  "errors":[]
    "results":380
    "paging":{
    "current":1
    "total":1
  }
  "response":
   [
     0:{
      "fixture":{...}
      "league":{...}
      "teams":{...}
      "goals":{...}
      "score":{...}
    }
     1:{
      "fixture":{...}
      "league":{...}
      "teams":{...}
      "goals":{...}
      "score":{...}
    }
    ...
   ]
}
```

### Dataframes

* **Seasons** 

This dataframe contains the results of the previous matches and are divided by season. From the API we can get information at least of the last 5 seasons. The shape of this dataframe looks like:

| id | season | match_date | local_team | away_team | local_goals | away_goals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 9) | 'Liverpool' | 'Norwich' | 4 | 1 |
| 2 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'West Ham' | 'Manchester City' | 0 | 5 |
| 3 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'Bournemouth' | 'Sheffield Utd' | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'Burnley' | 'Southampton' | 3 | 0 |
| 5 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'Crystal Palace' | 'Everton' | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 11) | 'Leicester' | 'Wolves' | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'Watford' | 'Brighton' | 0 | 3 |
| 8 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 10) | 'Tottenham' | 'Aston Villa' | 3 | 1 |
| 9 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 11) | 'Newcastle' | 'Arsenal' | 0 | 1 |
| 10 | 2019 | datetime.date(2019, 8, 11) | 'Manchester United' | 'Chelsea' | 4 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


* **Statistics**

This dataframe contains information about team players and their performance. On this dataframe, the information we have about players is: injuries, appareances, played minutes, assist and rating per player. These kind of statistics are relevant to infere the result of a soccer match. 

| id | season | player_id | player_name | age | injured | weight | appearences | minutes | position | rating | shots | goals | assist | total_duels | won_duels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2019 | 160 | 'M. Vorm' | 38 | False | 47 | 0 | 0 | 'Goalkeeper' | None | 0 | None | None | None | None |
| 2 | 2019 | 642 | 'S. AgÃ¼ero' | 33 | False | 50 | 24 | 1456 | 'Attacker' | 7.160869 | 16 | 3 | 79.0 | 114 | 43 |
| 3 | 2019 | 2795 | 'G. Sigurosson' | 33 | False | 45 | 35 | 2562 | 'Midfieder' | 6.854285 | 2 | 3 | 82.0 | 250 | 103 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


Some other characteristics important about our data:
* It has a total of 20 teams per season. 
* Each season, the team with worst performance is replaced by a new one. 
* Some matches can be rescheduled.
* There are a total of 380 matches in each season.
* The number of players by season can be vary.


### Feature engineering

Our feature engineering process is based on the match dataframe consisted in two steps: 

* **Creating the target variable:** this feature has 3 categories: local, away or draw. For this, we computed the difference between the local and away team goals by match. If this difference is possitive we assign "local" to the target variable, if it is negative we assign "away" and if the difference is zero we assign "draw". This was done using the following function: 

* **Computing the accumulated goals by team:** we sorted matches by date for each season and calculated the accumulated number of goals until the previous match. These goals are separated by: scored, received and the difference between them. It is important to notice that we don't consider the goals of that game to compute the sum to prevent data leakage, since the difference of goals is used to calculate the target variable.

We created this pair of functions: 

```python
def sumaGoles(golesEquipo, totalPartidos):
    favor = 0
    contra = 0
    diferencia = 0
    for i in range(totalPartidos):
        #print("sumando el partido "+str(i))
        favor+=golesEquipo[i][0]
        contra+=golesEquipo[i][1]
        diferencia+=golesEquipo[i][2]
    return [favor, contra, diferencia]
```

```python
def FeatureEngineer(anio,partialRes):
    equipos = {} # para contar los partidos jugados por equipo
    totalGoals = {} # primero a favor, luego en contra, luego diferencia
    for res in partialRes:
        if(res[1]==anio and res[5] != None): # != None validdation required for non played matches
            #datos de equipos
            local = res[3]
            visita = res[4]

            #datos de goles
            goles_local = res[5]
            goles_visita = res[6]

            if(not (local in equipos)):
                equipos[local] = 0

            if(not (visita in equipos)):
                equipos[visita] = 0

            #logica para guardar los goles por equipo y el acumulado
            if(local in totalGoals):
                totalGoals[local].append([goles_local,goles_visita, goles_local-goles_visita])
            else:
                totalGoals[local] = [[goles_local,goles_visita, goles_local-goles_visita]]

            if(visita in totalGoals):
                totalGoals[visita].append([goles_visita, goles_local, goles_visita-goles_local])
            else:
                totalGoals[visita] = [[goles_visita, goles_local, goles_visita-goles_local]]


    featureEng = []

    for partido in partialRes:
        if (partido[1]==anio and partido[5] != None): # != None validdation required for non played matches
            #print(partido)
            local = partido[3]
            visita = partido[4]
            goles_acumulados_local = sumaGoles(totalGoals[local], equipos[local])
            goles_acumulados_visita = sumaGoles(totalGoals[visita], equipos[visita])
            
            #ahora se define si gana el local, el visita o empate
            resPredictor = 'empate'
            if(partido[5]>partido[6]):
                resPredictor = 'local'
            else:
                if(partido[5]<partido[6]):
                    resPredictor = 'visita'
            
            featureEng.append([partido[1],
                        local,
                        goles_acumulados_local[0],
                        goles_acumulados_local[1],
                        goles_acumulados_local[2],
                        equipos[local],#partidos jugados hasta el momento              
                        visita,
                        goles_acumulados_visita[0],
                        goles_acumulados_visita[1],
                        goles_acumulados_visita[2],
                        equipos[visita],#partidos jugados hasta el momento  
                        resPredictor]
                             )
            equipos[local] = equipos[local]+1
            equipos[visita] = equipos[visita]+1


    return featureEng
```

### Algorithm

Since this is a clasification problem, we considered different algorithms. Starting with the simplest ones like logistic regression but also more complex like Perceptron.

On this case, the following algoritms were used:
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Nearest Neightbouts (KNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
* Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
* Perceptron

### Experiments

To understand the different experiments is important to know the next concepts:

* **Training and testing data:** since we are using data which contains implicit time values we decided to use 2019 and 2020 seasons to train the models and, the 2021 season to test.
* **Column transformer**: the local and away teams names were used to train the model. On this case, the model training requires to have this values as numerical ones, that's the reason why we use a one hot encoder to transform those categorical values.
* **Algorithms and hiperparameters**: As we mentioned above, different algorithms were used to find the best model and we assigned some hiperparameters to look at.
* **Cross validation**: since the Premier League has a finite amount of teams and matches during a season was necessary to use this technique to split the train set into two different sets. The cross validations was done 5 times with a 80-20% data split. This helps us to avoid statistical bias but also to improve the model performance. 
* **Pipeline:** it uses the column transformer mentioned above and start training a model with a set of fixed hiperparameters.
* **GridSearch:** it receives an array with the algorithm and different hiperparameters. For each combination of the different hiperparameters it sends the values to a pipeline to start the input data transformation and the model training. At the end of the iterations it picks the best model based on the target model metric.


On this case, we used 6 different algorithms with all the hiperparameters combinations as you can see on the table below.

**Algorithms and hiperparameters combinations**
| Algorithm | Hiperparameters |
| --- | --- |
| LR | 40 | 
| KNN | 60 | 
| SVM | 14 | 
| RFC | 324 | 
| GBC | 72 | 
| Perceptron | 9 | 
| Total | 519 | 
| --- | --- |
